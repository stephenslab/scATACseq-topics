Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/stephenslab/scATACseq-topics/tree/c1e1d7eca36a33d9a07255ee236219e686202b40" target="_blank">c1e1d7e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h3>Motif enrichment vs gene score</h3>
<p>Load pre-computed gene scores</p>
<p>Gene scores were computed using TSS based method as in Lareau <em>et al</em> Nature Biotech, 2019 as well as the <code>model 21</code> in <code>archR</code> paper. This model weights chromatin accessibility around gene promoters by using bi-directional exponential decays from the TSS.</p>
<ul>
<li>TSS model, normalized by the l2 norm of weights, as in Stouffer's z-score method.</li>
<li>use abs(z) scores</li>
</ul>
